LAUNCHING THE WEBSITE:

The command to launch the website is 
ssh -i keytwosixtee.pem ubuntu@54.162.250.12
being in this dirctory with the keytwosixtee.pem private key. DON'T put that in the GitHub.

GITHUB MERGES:
 - If there's a conflict, origin/main means the Github, while main means the local repository, AT LEAST according to Github Desktop, which is undoubtedly superior.
