LAUNCHING THE WEBSITE:

The command to launch the website is  

```ssh -i keytwosixtee.pem ubuntu@34.193.53.61```  

being in this dirctory with the keytwosixtee.pem private key. DON'T put that in the GitHub.

The command to deploy this garbage:  

```bash deployFiles.sh -k keytwosixtee.pem -h medicost.info -s simon```

    

GITHUB MERGES:
 - If there's a conflict, origin/main means the Github, while main means the local repository, AT LEAST according to Github Desktop, which is undoubtedly superior. 

 AWS PROBLEM:
 How do I do route 53 well with a transferred thingy?
